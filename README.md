    > **Warning**
    > Issues must be clear, concise, and actionable.  This means all of the relevant information you can think of must be included when creating the issue, it needs to be complete enough that someone else can take over the task without additional information.

## Additional Requirements

1. All issues must be linked to the GitHub repository, be assigned (to yourself), have appropriate label(s), belong to an iteration (sprint).
2. All added Python code must follow [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

Applying the single responsibility principle ...

3. You must use an issue branching strategy (one branch for each issue). See [Creating a branch for an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue#creating-a-branch-for-an-issue)
4. A pull request (PR) must only contain code changes for a single issue.
5. Each pull request (PR) must be linked to an issue.  See [Linking a pull request to an issue using a keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
