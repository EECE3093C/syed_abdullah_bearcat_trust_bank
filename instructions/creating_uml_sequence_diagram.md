# Creating a UML Sequence Diagram for Bank Account Interactions

**Objective**: Create a UML Sequence Diagram that illustrates the interactions between the classes `Bank`, `Account`, `SavingsAccount`, and `CheckingAccount` for creating accounts, depositing to a Checking account, and withdrawing from a Savings account.

## Instructions:

1. Review your **completed code** for the `Bank`, `Account`, `SavingsAccount`, and `CheckingAccount` classes.
2. Create a UML Sequence Diagram using the [mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io) syntax that includes the following interactions:
    * Creating a Savings account
    * Creating a Checking account
    * Depositing to a Checking account
    * Withdrawing from a Savings account
3. Add your UML Sequence Diagram to the [uml_sequence_diagram.md file](/docs/uml_sequence_diagram.md)  
<br/>

> **Note**
> Save your Mermaid diagram inside a fenced code block with the mermaid language identifier, for example:
>
> ````
> ```mermaid
> sequenceDiagram
> Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
> John-->>Alice: Great!
> Alice-)John: See you later!
> ```
> ````

### Resources:
1. For help with the mermaid.js syntax for sequence diagrams review the [mermaid.js documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/sequenceDiagram) 
2. The [Mermaid live editor](https://mermaid.live/) can be used to interactively design the UML Sequence Diagram. 
3. Review GitHub's [Creating Mermaid diagrams]([https://mermaid.live/](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams) documentation for help on including a Mermaid diagram in a Markdown file hosted on GitHub.
